> Be sure to create the database with an appropriate / matching version of SQLite management tool with the NppSnippets plugin!
For view and edit sqlite, I advice to use:
- SQLite Tools (official command line)
- [SQLite Studio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/)
- [Navicat](https://www.navicat.com/en/products/navicat-for-sqlite)
